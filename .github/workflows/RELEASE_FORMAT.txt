#### RetroPie 4.8 Standard

This image is recommended for most users. It is the standard 32-bit RetroPie installation.

#### PiOS RetroPie

**When using Raspberry Pi Imager, do not change the default username from `pi`**

This image a 64-bit PiOS base image which will build/install RetroPie on first boot. This image is recommended for advanced users.

The image should be flashed with Raspberry Pi Imager with WiFi customisations completed. Upon connecting to your network, RetroPie will start installing. This will take a time, make sure your PSPi is charging. Your PSPi may reboot several times during this process.

To install additional cores either use the retropie menu/script located at `/opt/RetroPie/retropie_setup.sh` or update retropie.conf located at `/boot/firmware/retropie.conf` You may also update this file by connecting your SD card to your PC and using a text editor.

### Batocera

This image is now over 2GB and has been split into multiple parts. Download each part into the same directory then extract with 7zip before flashing.

This image comes with [PortMaster](https://portmaster.games/) preinstalled.

PortMaster does not (yet) officially support Batocera, though we can get some (not all) games working.

To get started:

- Connect your device to the internet and launch PortMaster from the "ports" console. This will update PortMaster to the latest version.
- Install whatever games you would like to try and follow any included instructions.
