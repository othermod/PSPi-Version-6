## Image Details

### RetroPie

This RetroPie image will build/install RetroPie from https://github.com/RetroPie/RetroPie-Setup

The image should be flashed with Raspberry Pi Imager with WiFi customisations completed. Upon connecting to your network, RetroPie will install. This will take a LONG time (Upwards of an hour) make sure your PSPi is charging.

### Batocera

This image is now over 2GB and has been split into multiple parts. Download each part into the same directory then extract with 7zip before flashing.

This image comes with [PortMaster](https://portmaster.games/) preinstalled.

PortMaster does not (yet) officially support Batocera, though we can get some (not all) games working.

To get started:

- Connect your device to the internet and launch PortMaster from the "ports" console. This will update PortMaster to the latest version.
- Install whatever games you would like to try and follow any included instructions.
- Before launching a game, you need to open the game script in a text editor and change the "controlfolder" variable from `/roms/ports/PortMaster` to `/userdata/roms/ports/PortMaster` (See the included copy of Descent for an example)
